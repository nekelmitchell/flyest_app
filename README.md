Flyest Travel App  (A Work In Progress)

Flyest is a travel application designed specifically for individuals who travel for extended periods of time — including military personnel, backpackers, digital nomads, and immigrants relocating to a new country. This app is also helpful for individuals who are traveling for vacation or visiting for a short period of time.
Moving to a new country or visiting can be overwhelming, isolating, and sometimes dangerous. Flyest aims to reduce homesickness, increase situational awareness, and help users feel secure and confident in unfamiliar environments.

Our mission is simple:
Help travelers stay safe, informed, connected, and culturally confident — wherever they are in the world.
